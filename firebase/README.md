# firebase/

The Firebase backend that replaces Spring Boot + PostgreSQL — ADR 0009, branch `feat/firebase-backend`.

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `firestore.rules` | Who reads and writes what. The only thing between a client and the data |
| `rules-tests/` | One emulator test per rule. A rule without a test is treated as absent |
| `firestore.indexes.json` | Composite indexes for the board, "my requests", "my matches", history |
| `firebase.json` | Emulator ports: auth 9099, firestore 8081, functions 5001, UI 4000 |

The data model and the reason behind each rule: `docs/tech-lead/firestore-data-model.md`.

```bash
cd firebase
npm install
npm run test:rules     # starts the Firestore emulator, runs vitest, stops it (needs Java 21)
npm run emulators      # emulators + UI at http://localhost:4000, for poking by hand
```

Both use the project id `demo-lifelink`: the `demo-` prefix keeps the emulator from ever touching
the real `lifelinkkh` project.
